Hi, my name is Antonio TonkoviÄ‡.

I love developing web applications that solve real world problems that people have.

Technologies that I currently use the most are:
- React, Redux
- Node.js, Express
- PostgreSQL
- AWS (RDS and S3), Heroku
Other technologies/tools that I have experience with are:
- Java, Spring, Spring Cloud, Netflix Eureka
- C#, ASP.NET MVC, WinForms
- Python
- MongoDB, H2
- Docker
- Jest, supertest, Selenium
- Next.js.
I'm interested in improving my knowledge of ASP.NET and would like to do some projects with it in the future.
